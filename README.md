# Postman2CSharp

### Save yourself hours, days, or even weeks

[Postman2CSharp](https://postman2csharp.com) , a FREE tool that allows you to generate fully featured ApiClients by simply inputting your Postman collections. I hope this tool can make your development process easier, quicker, and more efficient. All generated ApiClient projects come fully packaged and have no dependencies on outside libraries. (Unless you choose Newtonsoft.Json as your json library).

Generated ApiClients are highly configurable to suit your needs. Full explanations about configurations can be found [here](https://postman2csharp.com/ApiClient-Configurations-Explained).

## Introduction

I'm tired of making ApiClients, you're tired of making ApiClients, we're all tired of it. It's always the same bs boilerplate code. You gotta keep looking back and forth between postman and visual studio to make sure you don't forget anything. We've all been there. We'll now you don't have to. You can use postman2csharp and be sure that all request parts are included in the generated code.

This doesn't however mean that the generated ApiClient are production ready. You will still need to review and fix the generated code.
